I am currently in the final year of my Bachelor's in Psychology at [Pontifical Catholic University of Peru](https://en.departamento-psicologia.pucp.edu.pe), where I work as a Research Assistant. I also work as a Research Assistant at the [Mood Disorders Laboratory](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/beevers/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu).

I like to think of my research interests as a nice intersection between mathematics, psychology, and neuroscience, focusing on learning dynamics in brains, minds and machines. Specifically, I want to understand how we can use different mathematical frameworks (such as dynamical systems or reinforcement learning) to make sense of sequential learning information (choice information, neural data) to understand how the involved processes work, what different types of inter-subject and inter-group variation we can find by looking at them, and how come things go awry in mental illness.

The part I like the most about the scientific process is thinking about different ways to mathematically formalize my intuitions in such a way that they turn into testable formal predictions in the real world. Mainly because of that, my favourite tool for scientific shennanigans is mathematical modeling and simulations.

Besides research, I also enjoy reading, watching MUBI movies, going for long runs, hitting the gym and having niche teas (:

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

 Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

 Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
