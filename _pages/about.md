I am currently in the final year of my Bachelor's in Psychology at [Pontifical Catholic University of Peru](https://en.departamento-psicologia.pucp.edu.pe), where I work as a Research Assistant. I also work as a Research Assistant at the [Mood Disorders Laboratory](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/beevers/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu).

<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm interested in understanding learning in humans and machines, for which I like using mathematical modeling and computers doing _beep boop beep_ :) . 
=======
I am interested in studying and conducting research at the intersection of mathematics, psychology and neurosciences, with a focus on learning dynamics in brains and machines (:

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

 Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

 Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
